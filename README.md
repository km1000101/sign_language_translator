## üßè About Sign Language
**Sign language** is a visual language that is used by deaf people as their mother tongue. Unlike acoustically conveyed sound patterns, sign language uses body language and manual communication to fluidly convey the thoughts of a person. Due to the considerable time required in learning Sign Language, it becomes difficult to communicate with these specially abled people, creating a communication gap.
